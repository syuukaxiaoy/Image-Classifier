# Image-Classifier
Use a deep learning model trained on  images as part of the overall application architecture
Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, I'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications.

I'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. We can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells us the name of the flower our camera is looking at. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below.

part 1

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

 - Load and preprocess the image dataset
 - Train the image classifier on dataset
 - Use the trained classifier to predict image content
